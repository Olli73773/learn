**During my career, I've joined two stealth/pre-general availability startups to figure out how to get our first customers to pay us money. For folks that are in the same boat, primarily working on high-touch or high dollar technical products, it can be a real challenge.** 

**To successfully achieve product-market-fit, you're simultaneously having to:**

1. Build a product that delivers some value to someone and company
2. Get meetings with the people that should care about this and need your product
3. Build credibility that you will be around to support this product
4. Get a prospect (not yet a customer) to deploy the product in an environment that matters
5. Present a proposal while you're still figuring out what you should be charging
6. Negotiate with stakeholders that don't understand and/or seem to care about the value of your product
7. Commit to contractual obligations that you aren't entirely sure you can meet
8. Get contract, celebrate, figure out how you'll deliver
9. Onboard customer and all their users
10. Try and do it again while keeping up with the bug fixes and feature requests from customer #1

**I've learned that doing this more than once, and at larger companies introducing new products, makes me more qualified than most to explain how it can work for you.** 

**Here are some guiding principles I've used to secure those first few wins:**

1. Nobody wants to be a guinea pig. Early adopters *must* feel that the problem your company is solving is a top priority for them or their company.
2. You are an expert in your technology and have a deep understanding of the space. Your prospect is not (yet). Your value is in guiding them through this understanding and the risk associated with status quo (without patronizing or 40 slides).
3. Prospects need reassurance that you are not going to waste their time. They need a plan to follow.
3. Deals live and die by momentum. Every interaction with you or the product has the ability to build momentum.
4. There must be an exchange of value in most, if not all, interactions.
5. Prospects pay more money when the immediate (or independently felt) pain can be tied to a business reward or a risk - these can be revenue, profitability, churn, attrition, compliance, etc.

**And in an ideal world, I'd stack-rank prioritize landing my first customers in the following order:**

1. Highly engaged, excellent adoption, significant contribution to articulation of value, problem definition. I call these design partners.
2. Recognizable logos
3. Revenue potential

**Why?**

**#1** leads to a story that resonates, a customer that advocates on your behalf, and a deep understanding of the stakeholders, problem description, and the quantification of value.
**#2** establishes credibility that you'll need to recruit talent, begin to scale sales, and attract the attention of analysts and influencers.
**#3** is greatly influenced by your ability to do #1 and #2. Pricing becomes defensible. Cost of sales decreases. Repeatability becomes achievable. Sales cycles shorten.

If you're lucky, you'll land early customers that fit in multiple buckets. Multiple design partners I've worked with have been publicly traded or well-known brands, led to $M+ initial deals, and expanded over time. Needless to say, it's totally possible depending on the problem you're solving!
