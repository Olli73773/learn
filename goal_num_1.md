I still get nervous prior to some sales calls. Oddly enough, these same calls are the ones that I get most excited about. 

What's so unique about these calls? 

Uncertainty. 

You may ask, but Josh, you've been on thousands (literally) of customer calls, are you serious?

Uncertainty comes from not having a clear path of what success looks like, and an idea of what the outcome should look like. And for me, this feeling is absolutely what I live for. 

When it happens, it's usually because:
- I'm working with new user-type and don't have an understanding of their "JTBD - Jobs to be Done"
- I'm working in a new space and don't have the market and historical context yet to establish credibility quickly
- I don't yet have the confidence that we can deliver an outcome
- It's high stakes, and I may not get another shot

The thing about this uncertainty is that it is fleeting. With experience and greater knowledge, those bullets above quickly disappear. I've found that the single fastest way to replace uncertainty with confidence is by striving to make every qualified engagement a **case study**.

# The power of the case study

We've all read case studies. The great ones have a few important components:
- Before and After Numbers: Quantified value, ideally at the individual and company level
- A Seemingly Insurmountable Problem: Description of the issue, the failed attempts at solving (ideally competitive), risking business outcomes
- A Hero: The person that would seek out your solution
- An Executive Sponsor: That one quote that communicates to all the would-be heroes that this is important and you'll get the support you need
- Utopia: Life is good, and this is what it looks like...come join me
- Partnership: This is just a milestone, and here's what's we expect to achieve together next

Every sales call is laying the groundwork to hit on all those bulletpoints. When I hear pain or business impact, I need to get to numbers. I need to understand what is the process that is contributing to that pain. I need to know who all is impacted, and what the longterm effects may be. I need to know why they have or haven't tried to solve this problem yet. If they have tried, I need to know where they faltered or failed. I need to understand who all cares about this problem. 

With those inputs, I feel unstoppable. After a handful of these, patterns emerge. Sales gets ~~easy~~easier.

*But there is so much more that you'll get out of this mentality*

If you start documenting these *case studies* internally, you'll benefit in countless ways:
1. Your narrative aka pitch will resonate better
2. You'll be able to onboard employees faster, with greater customer empathy
3. You'll earn customer trust through the credibility you create
4. You'll have ready-made business justifications for the current and future transactions
5. You'll have case studies ready to be flipped into marketing materials (with customer consent)
6. You'll have negotiation leverage
7. You'll have references

In fact, at my last startup, I worked with customer contacts to verify information and contribute to these internal case studies. You're probably wondering why they'd do that? Early customers want you to be successful. I presented this as an opportunity for us organizationally to gain a better understanding of the challenges our customers face and what we can do to help them solve them. Additionally, customers take on risk when they adopt your technology early in its lifecycle. They need help communicating the value to derisk the decision. An *internal case study* does that exceptionally well.

## Takeaway

Although each call will have a goal - get them to evaluation, get to power, find a project, whatever it is... - maintaining high-level sight on filling out that case study criteria will help you and anyone you bring on get there that much faster.
