**Every customer has a solution to their problem. It's just suboptimal.**

Every founder or sales rep I speak to hears this and immediately has a reaction, so I'm sharing it with you. 

When you frame your sales process like this, you are forcing yourself to:
1. Be curious - What is their current process or solution, and what are the gaps?
2. Help your prospect define the problem, especially in nascent markets/problem spaces
3. Understand all the competition, not just the technologies you compete with
4. Quantify breadth of impact for each way of solving this problem
5. Understand how prospects prioritize these problems and how they're linked to business outcomes

I'm currently reading a book called [The Secret Lives of Customers](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Lives-Customers-Detective-Customer/dp/1541774493) by David Scott Duncan. The author details the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework for understanding why customers hire certain solutions/vendors. There are 4 questions required to understand user behavior:
1. What circumstance is your customer in when they seek out/use a solution?
2. What are they trying to do when they use the solution?
3. How do they define quality, or its ability to fulfill the requirement?
4. What are other workarounds they may use (or have used) to achieve the same goal(s)?

This framework has helped me in truly understanding how to articulate the narratives for various products based on who I'm speaking with, and also how to guide my questions around clear thematic pain points with various solutions. Give it a try!
