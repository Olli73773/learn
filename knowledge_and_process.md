I've met and worked with a number of early founders. They all had one thing in common, a deep understanding of the product they were building. Yet, some of these founders never went on to earn a dollar from their product. Others were fortunate to land a few first customers, but unsuccessful in getting to anything repeatable. And then there was a much smaller group that found a path to consistent and predictable growth, adding logos and revenue with apparent ease. 

#How come?

It comes down to two relatively simple concepts: **knowledge** *and* **process**

In this context, knowledge is defined as having a deep understanding of:
1. market trends
2. competition
3. target users
4. product
5. material impact of the problem (emotional and quantifitative)

I'm starting with knowledge because without mastery of the above, it's unlikely that you'll ever make a real sale, regardless of the maturity of your process. If you are a founder and you (or your cofounders) do not currently have a deep understanding of *all 5* of the above, then you are going to struggle. 

#Why?

In my experience, it's much more difficult to pattern match (a skill required for scaling) without first having a firm grasp on the dimensions across each of the above items. As a salesperson, this is one of the most challenging thing for new Account Executives (AEs) to do well. Without having a strong contextual foundation consisting of these items, it's common to see early founders and less experienced AEs pick up the cues and ask the questions required to generate a much deeper understanding of motives, triggering events, and cause and effect.  

#But we're too small to put in all these "processes"

Early, lightweight processes actually simplify decision-making and accelerate learning. 

I'm defining process as a collection of mental models used to build and/or reinforce the following:
1. credibility in your ability to fulfill stated vision
2. momentum throughout the engagement
3. institutionalization of learnings
4. accountability - internally and externally
5. a customer-centric culture
6. sales pipeline
7. bigger deals
8. predictability

Since I haven't really found a great resource that touches on this topic, especially in targeting early stage sales, it's worth going into detail on each.

**Credibility**
One of the biggest challenges for early-stage companies is to build credibility with their audience. This is why you see long-winded bios of founders and seed stage funding announcements.
