Hi, my name is Josh and I specialize in selling early-stage, mostly unproven (at least commercially) technology. Self-promotion has never been a strong suit for me, so you're probably not going to see me plastered across the internet. The bulk of my reputation has come from building upon sales experience after sales experience by seeking out uncomfortable and somewhat ambiguous sales roles with steep learning curves where resourcefulness and "figuring it out" have been crucial to success. 

After more than 10 years in sales, I've realized that being a *do-er* across industries, segments, deal sizes, and company stages has provided me with a unique perspective available to help others seeking to have more success in tech sales. I enjoy being a part of even the earliest transactions, as every interaction has the potential to inform what is needed to scale.
