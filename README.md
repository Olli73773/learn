# learn
Hi, my name is Josh and I specialize in selling early-stage, mostly unproven (at least commercially) technology. Self-promotion has never been a strong suit for me, so you're probably not going to see me plastered across LinkedIn or Twitter. I have repeatedly gravitated towards uncomfortable situations with steep learning curves where resourcefulness and "figuring it out" have served me well. 

After more than 10 years in sales, I've realized that being a *do-er* across industries, segments, deal sizes, and company stages ahas provided me with a unique perspective to help others that strive to have more success in tech sales. I enjoy being a part of even the earliest transactions, as every interaction has the potential to inform what is needed to scale. 

I can be reached via DM on Twitter @sudotechie, linkedin @ www.linkedin.com/in/joshgrose
